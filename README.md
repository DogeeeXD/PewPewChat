- Optimize Firestore read and writes
- Edit user profile

- More...


## Note

 - Firebase config files are not uploaded for privacy issue.
 
 - Automated push notification is not available because NodeJS 10 is needed and I currently don't have Blaze plan for Firebase. 

 - The code isn't optimized as this is just a demo, not a production app.
 
 - Some functions are not yet implemented due to limited free time.
